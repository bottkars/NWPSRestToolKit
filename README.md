# NWPSRestToolKit

[Dell Developer API Marketplace](https://developer.dell.com/apis/2378/versions/v3/docs/tutorials/Tutorial-1APIBasics.md)  
Powershell Toolkit for Networker Rest API  
### about
the Goal of the Networker Powershell Toolkit is to make a Networker AdminÂ´s live on windows easier  
teh Toolkit should support Pielining of commands, and combine the value of Powershell with the strength of the RestAPI


### requirements
in order to run the commands, you need to unrestrict executionpolicy.
also, make sure to unblock the zipfile if you download the modules as zip and not via git ( unblock-file or right click in explorer )
open a powershell as admin and run
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```
### Notice
! all commands ending with an "s"  represent a plural and derived from the api. however, in my process of object re-writes i will also switch to singular commands without trailing "s"
if there are examples with the plural, they might change to singular ( eg. clients to client ! )

## installation  
The Modules are loaded via Import-Module NWPSRestToolKit
The Module sudirectories are based on the methods and functions , eg GET,PUT,POST..., errors.

use this Automatic downloader to install NWPSRestToolKit:

Invoke-WebRequest -Uri $Uri -OutFile $OutFile

## alternative installation  
if not using the Downloader, i Recommend cloning into the modules using and do regular pulls for update rather than downloading the zip. this also eliminates the need for unblocking the zip archive !!! )
